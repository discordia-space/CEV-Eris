## Remove "SS13_" if you are using the standard schema file.
TABLEPREFIX SS13_

## Time in seconds for asynchronous queries to timeout
## Set to 0 for infinite
ASYNC_QUERY_TIMEOUT 10

## Time in seconds for blocking queries to execute before slow query timeout
## Set to 0 for infinite
## Must be less than or equal to ASYNC_QUERY_TIMEOUT
BLOCKING_QUERY_TIMEOUT 5

## The minimum number of sql connections to keep around in the pool. Setting this higher on servers geographically away from the database can improve performance.

## The maximum number of sql connections to the database.
POOLING_MAX_SQL_CONNECTIONS 25

## The maximum number of concurrent asynchronous queries that can be pending a result before we start queuing further database queries.
