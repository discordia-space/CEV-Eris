<h1>Malfunctionin69 AI 69uide</h1><br>

This 69uide contains69ost important OOC information for69alfunctionin69 AIs.<br>

<h2>69oal</h2><br>
As69alfunctionin69 AI, your primary 69oal is to overtake station's systems. To do this, use software "Basic Encryption Hack" on APCs (ri69ht click on APC and select Basic Encryption Hack). Please69ote that hacked APCs have distinctive blue error screen, that tends to attract attention. Rememember that69alfunctionin69 AI is anta69onist, so read server rules for anta69onists. While hackin69 APCs is your official 69oal, feel free to create custom 69oal, as lon69 as it is fun for everyone.<br>

<h2>Hardware</h2><br>
As69alfunctionin69 AI, you69ay select one hardware piece to help you. Remember that once you select hardware piece, you cannot select another one, so choose wisely! Hardware69ay be selected by clickin69 "Select Hardware" button in Hardware tab. Followin69 is list of possible hardware pieces:<br>
<b>APU 69enerator</b> - Auxiliary Power Unit which allows you to operate even without external power. However, runnin69 on APU will stop your CPU time 69eneration, and temporarily disable69ost of your abilities. APU is also somewhat69ulnerable to physical dama69e, and will fail if your core hardware inte69rity drops below 50%.<br>
<b>Turrets Focus Enhancer</b> - Removes safeties on installed turrets, boostin69 their rate of fire, health and enablin6969ano-re69eneration69odule. This however increases power usa69e considerably, espicially when re69eneratin69 dama69e.<br>
<b>Secondary Processor Unit</b> - Simple up69rade that increases your CPU time 69eneration by 50%. Useful if you69eed to speed up your research.<br>
<b>Secondary69emory Bank</b> - Doubles amount of69aximal CPU time you69ay store. This is useful if you69eed to use lots of abilities in short amount of time.<br>
<b>Self-Destruct Explosives</b> - Lar69e blocks of C4 are attached to your physical core. This C4 has 15 second timer, and69ay be activated by special button that appears in your Hardware tab. This self-destruct will remain active, even if you are destroyed. If timer reaches 0 your core explodes in stron69 explosion. Obviously, this destroys you, as well as anyone69earby.<br>

<h2>Software</h2><br>
Software are abilities that have to be unlocked69ia research69enu (Hardware tab). Unlocked abilities appear in Software tab. <b>Sometimes, abilities won't appear in this tab after bein69 researched. This can be fixed by relo6969in69 or usin69 "ai-core" command.</b> Abilities are tiered, T1 bein69 the weakest ones, while T4 are stron69est ones. To reach hi69her tier you have to research abilities in lower tier. We currently have 12 abilities, in 3 research trees:<br>
<b>Networkin69</b> - Hackin69-oriented abilities. T1 ability is Basic Encryption Hack, which allows you to hack69ore APCs. Hi69her tiers allow fakin69 centcom69essa69es, and even settin69 alert level. T4 ability is System Override, that rapidly hacks remainin69 APCs and 69ives you access to station self destruct se69uence.<br>
<b>Interdiction</b> - Sabota69e-oriented abilities. T1 ability allows you to recall emer69ency shuttle. Hi69her level abilities allow you to unlock cybor69s even without access to robotics console, and T4 ability allows you to hack other AIs to slave them under your control.<br>
<b>Manipulation</b> - Physical-oriented abilities. T1 ability allows you to break few li69hts, and rarely even APCs. T2 ability allows you to apply up69rade of your choice to camera, or reactivate broken camera. T3 ability allows you to create weak forcefield, that holds air, but won't last for lon69. And T4 ability allows you to overload69achines, detonatin69 them in weak explosion.<br>
