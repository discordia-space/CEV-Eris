changes:
  - balance: Organ mod installation has 100% success rate at 35 BIO
  - balance: intracrinal organoids increase a given stat by 5, intracrinal membranes
      increase it by 10
  - balance: Disgorger stomach, liver, kidney efficiency affects reagent-to-substrate
      conversion ratio, muscle efficiency better improves process speed, accepts nutriment,
      checks reagents before biomatter content
  - bugfix: Disgorger can handle child reagent types
  - balance: Parenchymal mods can be adjusted
  - balance: Parenchymal membranes have double base efficiency, but only one organ
      type
  - balance: Organ scaffold price reduced to 100, organ mod price reduced to 25
  - balance: Vendor aberrant organs tweaked to have type 2 hormones and 2u reagent
      output
  - balance: Organ fab base and starting biotic substrate increased to 480
  - tweak: Internal organs show efficiencies and mods at 35 BIO
  - bugfix: Kidney efficiency mods are no longer halved
  - bugfix: Fixed an issue where organs with new efficiencies weren't being added
      correctly when modded during surgery
