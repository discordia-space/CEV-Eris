changes:
  - balance: Most shields were buffed
  - tweak: Tactical shield (riot) renamed to ballistic shield
  - balance: Ballistic shields no longer fit in backpacks
  - balance: Riot-size shields now provide partial protection to the legs, buckler-size
      provide partial protection to the head and groin (50% chance to activate as
      opposed to 100%)
  - rscadd: Compact Ironhammer tactical shield, three spawn in armory
  - rscadd: Ironhammer shield module for hardsuits, one spawns in armory
  - rscadd: NT parma shield, printable from the basic melee design disk
  - balance: Shields no longer take penetration value into account. Gauss coil barrels
      are still effective however, as they signficantly increase AP
  - imageadd: Sprites for the Parma and Tactical shields done by CeUvi
  - tweak: NT spears are now repaired with a hammer
  - bugfix: Buckler and Trayshield sprites were fixed
  - balance: Shields now give extra melee block chance depending on Robustness. Lighter
      and smaller shields generally benefit more, at the cost of lower starting levels
