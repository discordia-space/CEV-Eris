changes:
  - rscadd: Gold golems; lethal ranged enemies that summon spikes under their target
  - balance: massive difficulty increase for cave mining; Spawns have been reworked
      to spawn golems in groups with types dependent on seismic level. Additionally,
      new types have been added, some have been reworked and their AI has been tuned
      up to let them see further and attack in coordinated groups, making it far more
      difficult to pick them off alone.
  - rscdel: Miner's shotgun and jackhammer.
  - imageadd: added icons for gold golem spikes
  - code_imp: Basic grab functionality for superior animals; their AI still isn't
      set to do this, so it must be trigged externally by each mob that intends to
      grab.
  - rscdel: Tile-based resources. Nothing actually used them, anyway.
