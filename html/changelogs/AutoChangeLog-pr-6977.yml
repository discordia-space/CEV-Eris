changes:
  - balance: Rebalance armor numbers. In general, lower tier armors should be more
      valuable now, and some things that didn't seem like they should be so armored
      were reduced.
  - balance: Gave lasers to compensate for armor change, plasma already has enough
      to be sustainable.
  - balance: Removed ablative's ability to deflect projectiles, to make it less of
      a hard counter to certain weapons.
  - tweak: Renamed heavy armor vest to mercenary armor vest.
