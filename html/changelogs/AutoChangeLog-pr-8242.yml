changes:
  - rscadd: new sprite for the old generic jumpsuits, based on the crewman jumpsuit
  - rscadd: new sprites for old softcaps, to match the jumpsuits (Orange avoided because
      vagabond resprite is WIP)
  - rscadd: completely new syndicate cap for crew to use, an old piece of fashion
      still produced for patriots and history fans alike. Possibly a veteran or two
      as well
  - rscadd: new sprite for the baseball bat based on the nailbat's sprite
  - rscadd: recolor of the galoshes to look better. Matches with insuls, they are
      both rubber after all
  - rscadd: new casual suit for people to use, a salmon shirt and corduroy pants.
      Perfect for an office worker
  - rscadd: variants of boots and reinforced shoes to the loadout (IH and oberth)
