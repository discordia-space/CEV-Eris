  - rscadd: 'Added a new mech weapon: the NT \"Warhead\" mace! In its mace mode, it
      will absolutely obliterate structures and people. Using it in hand will convert
      it to a flail that does less damage but has a longer range and weakens + knocks
      back targets.'
  - rscadd: 'Added a new mech weapon: the BFG! After a lengthy charging period, this
      massive cannon shoots a massive bolt of plasma energy that does loads of damage
      in a wide radius.'
  - rscadd: 'Added a new mech weapon: the mounted crossbow! Insert in materials to
      load as crossbow bolts - the harder and heavier the material, the more armor
      penetration and damage it has respectively.'
