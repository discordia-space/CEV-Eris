  VmpOS2NHSkhkejA9:
  - rscadd: Gold golems; lethal ranged enemies that summon spikes under their target
  - balance: massive difficulty increase for cave mining; Spawns have been reworked
      to spawn golems in groups with types dependent on seismic level. Additionally,
      new types have been added, some have been reworked and their AI has been tuned
      up to let them see further and attack in coordinated groups, making it far more
      difficult to pick them off alone.
  - rscdel: Miner's shotgun and jackhammer.
  - imageadd: added icons for gold golem spikes
  - code_imp: Basic grab functionality for superior animals; their AI still isn't
      set to do this, so it must be trigged externally by each mob that intends to
      grab.
  - rscdel: Tile-based resources. Nothing actually used them, anyway.
  - tweak: Ammo is compressed into stacks when dumped from boxes and magazines.
  - tweak: Material stacks merge when moving over each other and when created.
  - balance: Ammo piles deal no fall damage unless there's 10 or more casings in the
      pile.
  - balance: Stacks deal fall damage based on the number of sheets in the stack.
  - balance: Osmium deals 2.5x more fall damage than other stack types.

  - tweak: Techno Storage no longer contains setup boards for the medical or security
      records. These have been replaced with appropriate setup disks.
  - balance: Groin efficiency now affects your getting up speed. If you have none,
      you can't do it!
