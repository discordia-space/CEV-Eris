  - tweak: lumped a lot of loadout items together into their own lists, like the ponchos,
      sneakers, and puffy jackets.
  - tweak: made the red "nanotrasen" beret usable by everyone and made it more ambiguous
      to who made it, so that everyone can have a red military beret.
  - tweak: swapped the names of the assistant formal uniform and tuxedo, as the assistant
      formal uniform looks like an actual tuxedo more than the "tuxedo" and made it
      no longer locked to vagabonds, considering that's a holdover. (I didn't actually
      call the old tuxedo the "assistant formal uniform" it's just the "black formal
      suit" now
  - tweak: changed some of the point costs for items in the loadouts since making
      the jackets 2 is kind of stupid considering there's other jackets with 1 with
      the exact same stats, ie the punk ones.
  - tweak: put the triad jacket into the contraband section of the style vendor to
      slightly dampen it's usage (and because it's kind of funny).
