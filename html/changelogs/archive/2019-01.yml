  < Nanako >:
  - experiment: Major overhaul of Excelsior. Finally they have recieved the Healing
      Touch of Nanako.
  - rscadd: Implants now work. In addition, we made implants generally implantable
      in nonhuman organic mobs. This allows excelsior to implant their pets so that
      turrets and shields don't target them.
  - rscadd: Added a couple new item recipes, disk cloner and the new Excelsior armored
      space suit, sprites thanks to Watler.
  - rscadd: Excelsior Armor is balanced around the teleporter. It requires a moderate
      amount of plasteel, and you can manufacture a full set every 10 minutes. It's
      moderately powerful all around, especially vs laser weapons.
  - tweak: Excelsior Shieldwall now unlocks for any excelsior instead of requiring
      engineering access. The shield barrier itself now also selectively allows excelsior-implanted
      people through, while blocking the normies.
  - tweak: Majorly reworked Excelsior Mine. Once armed, detonates when any non-excelsior
      walks over it.
  - tweak: Excelsior Autolathe now requires no extra parts and comes with a free beaker
      preinstalled.
  - tweak: Rebalanced material costs of Excelsior Teleporter a little bit.
  - tweak: Hugely buffed Diesel Generator in both capacity and power consumption.
  - experiment: Major Payday rework Crew are now paid once per hour, with an email
      being sent to notify them of this, as well as the shipwide announcement of payday.
  - rscadd: Departments themselves are also paid, each department gets an hourly budget
      infusion to their departmental funds, drawn from the same source as their wages.
  - rscadd: The Ship Account now starts with three million credits. It is used to
      pay other departments as outlined above. Captain is encouraged to roleplay with
      the money and not just make it rain from the catwalks.
  - tweak: Instead of captain, now any head of staff is required to start the round.
  - rscadd: Added a few more grenade types to the grenades section of the Uplink.
      Frags, highex, teargas, with appropriate costs.
  - rscadd: Added two spawning grenades to the grenades section of the Uplink. The
      Viscerator spawner and Bioweapon sample.
  - rscadd: Added a smaller Spending Money bundle to the uplink. 1 TC, 500 credits.
  - tweak: Rebalanced TC costs of many things in Uplink. Generally, guns are cheaper
      to reflect their ready availability on Eris. Money is now far more expensive.
  - tweak: More tweaks for mopping to make floors stay clean longer once cleaned.
  - tweak: Nerfed robot VTec upgrade.
  - tweak: Reduced power of stunbeam tasers, to bring them in line with similar lethal
      weapons.
  - tweak: Reduced siemens coefficient of SCAF suit, making mercenaries more resistant
      to tasers.

      instead added ten random hardsuit module spawns.

      and a few other stationary related locations around the ship. Intended for aiding
      in taping up notices to walls.
  - maptweak: Added several mapped in vial boxes to the chemistry lab, to go along
      with the vial pouches.
  - maptweak: 'Added fire axe cabinets. Here''s Johnny! '
  - maptweak: Added one additional ATM, in the hallway just above cryostorage.

      told to kill themselves.

  Nanako:
  - rscadd: Adds new sprites for the Ironhammer Voidsuit. By Watler. Now they are
      regularly available in the lower armoury.
  - maptweak: An Ironhammer operative entering the armoury now has a total of six
      armour options available to them, and all of these have their advantages and
      drawbacks.
  - maptweak: Rearranged things in the armoury to add three voidsuit spawns, along
      with magboots and jetpack for each. Removed several of the gasmasks, oxygen
      tanks, and portable flashers. And instead added in some double capacity emergency
      tanks, and an oxygen canister for refilling.
  - tweak: Extended Excelsior turret working range by 50%.
  - tweak: The voidsuit's stats are reworked a bit, and its positioned squarely inbetween
      the stats of a normal vest, and an IH rig suit. The rig is both better armored
      and faster, but the voidsuit is less demanding on your storage space.
  - tweak: Slightly buffed the stats of ironhammer hardsuit, and serbian SCAF suit,
      based on observations of combat performance.
  - tweak: Buffed the Chief Engineer's rig too, for such a vital role they have an
      alarmingly common habit of dying alone in maintenance.
  - tweak: Buffed the handmade armor vest, because it sucks and nobody uses it.
  - tweak: Slightly buffed the non primary stats of the three specialist vests to
      keep them viable, but also added minor slowdown to bulletproof and ablative
      vest.
  - tweak: Added many parts to the excelsior disk so they can actually create shield
      generators.
  - bugfix: Fixed the excelsior autolathe not working properly when manually constructed.
  - bugfix: Fixed infinitely duplicating energy guns when disassembling turrets.
  - bugfix: Fixed zero initial bank balance.
  - bugfix: Allowed slots on suits not allowing large weapons.
  - bugfix: Fixed fireaxe sprites when facing east.
  - bugfix: Fixed excelsior implants not being properly setup when spawned by storyteller,
      resulting in their own turrets shooting them.
  - bugfix: Fixed storyteller having a defunct 'roleset' option in the roleset pool
      which wasted antag points.
  - tweak: Majorly reworked how material costs are calculated for protolathe, autolathe
      and circuit imprinter designs. Some costs were adjusted in the process
  - tweak: Made the prices of ordering materials in the guild far cheaper. Also added
      a bulk metal crate for large quantities of steel at once.
