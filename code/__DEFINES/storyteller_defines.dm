//Event tags. These loosely describe what the event will do to the ship and crew
//Storytellers can vary the weighting and cost of events based on these tags

//Example: Infestation, spiders, carp
//Most antags are tagged combat too
//Combat events usually create work for ironhammer and medical

//The event involves one or very few people. The people who are unaffected often won't care
//Examples: Ion storm, viral infection

//Examples: Radiation storm, lights out, comms blackout

//Examples: Meteors, APC damage, camera failure
//Destructive events usually create work for engineers
