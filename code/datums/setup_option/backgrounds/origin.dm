			For the fleet to function, a gigantic amount of manpower is required, and the armada's ships tend to be as populous as small cities, with both civilians and military personnel. \
			Life in the Fleet is rather dull and spartan most of the time, with deep traditions of asceticism rooted in the crew of every ship. \

The workers of Kestrel Hive, real rough folk, partake in several very dangerous recreational activities, from hopping from asteroid to asteroid with just your EVA suit and a spare tank of oxygen, to rocket-fuel and pure ethanol booze, with bits of radioactive byproducts mixed in.
