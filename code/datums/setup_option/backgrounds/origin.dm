			For the fleet to function, a gigantic amount of manpower is required, and the armada's ships tend to be as populous as small cities, with both civilians and military personnel. \
			Life in the Fleet is rather dull and spartan most of the time, with deep traditions of asceticism rooted in the crew of every ship. \

			Even before the war it was full of conflicts between local governments, pirates and corporations, and it just got worse afterwards. \
			While it's formally under Hanza control now, the war resulted in a fall of many governments, thus the anarchy spreads, and patchwork states are being born and die every year. \
