/*
Gun part point system:
Each part contains a few upgrades and downgrades, these have conditional point costs to use.
Currently there is no automated way to calculate them, so follow this guide:

STAT changes:
damage - 1 point / 0.05
penetration - 1 point / 0.1

RECOIL: (bound to change)
+SEMI - 1 point / 0.25
-SEMI - 1 point / 0.125
+2burst - 1.5 points / 0.25
+FA - 1 point / 0.125
-FA - 2 point / 0.125

FIREMODES:
2-burst - 4 points
3/5 burst - 5 points
300 FA - 7 points
400 FA - 8 points
600 FA - 9 points

MODIFICATION:
3-burst/FA doesn't accept drum - -1 points
semi accepts weird caliber - +1 points
3-burst/FA accepts weird caliber - +2 points
