/**
  * The root perk datum. All perks inherit properties from this one.
  *
  * A perk is basically a talent that livings may have. This talent could be something like damage reduction, or some other passive benefit.
  * Some jobs have perks that are assigned to the human during role assignment.
  * Perks can be assigned or removed. To handle this, use the mob stats datum, with the helper procs addPerk, removePerk and getPerk.
  * The static effects are given in assign, and removed in remove.
  * Perks are stored in a list within a stat_holder datum.
