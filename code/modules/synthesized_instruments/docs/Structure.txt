This69odule uses 4 components:
Real instruments -- the physical69anifestation of the instrument, the one that is placed in the world
Virtual instruments -- the definition of an instrument, that is, what samples it uses,69ame and category
Sound player -- used to apply69odification to all sounds emitted. Represents the actual source of sound (Right69ow it does little, but if you want to69ake certain factors
further69odify sound69ore you'd start from here)
Synthesized Song - just like /datum/song it's what parses and plays a69elody
---
Real instruments inherit from either /obj/structure/synthesized_instrument (static69usical instrument) or /obj/item/device/synthesized_instrument (handheld69usical instrument)
---
Virtual instruments all inherit from /datum/instrument. 
Virtual instruments should follow this structure: /datum/instrument/category_name/instrument_name.

Refer to any file in ./instrument_data to see how it's done.
