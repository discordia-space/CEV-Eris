/*
	These datums are used to handle ztravel in multiz/movement.dm. That is, vertical movement between
	floors/zlevels. This system is designed to handle jetpacks, climbing, superhuman jumping, etc.
	In future it can be expanded to flight and grappling hooks

	Each vertical_travel_method datum details one possible method of motion

	Each one contains a proc used to query whether the mob is currently able to ztravel via this method
	Each one also contains an optional animation proc which is run asynchronously (in a spawn call)
		This animation proc is used to do pixel offsets, scaling, etc

	For now, one of every possible method is created and used to test, then deleted if it can't run
	This design offers a future possibility of optimisation by having each mob store a list of methods
	which they could possibly use, based on equipment. And only checking those

	The #1 rule when writing a VTM datum: Always call parent, using .=..() at the top of your function
	Unless you're reeeally sure what you're doing
