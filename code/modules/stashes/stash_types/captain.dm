 Kismet, my captain.<br>\
 You were too vainglorious for anything but that damned fine hat. As for your effects, the mutineers won't have them.<br>\

 Lest I forget, %D"

<br>\
 Teach him to cut the rum ration. Like how rowdy we were now ya screaming pig?<br>\

 The boys took his shit off him and we'll sort it out later, once we pretend the good stuff was missing after we divvy with the crew.<br>\
 Keeping it here to be safe. %D"

 We've divvied up the new slaves, old hands getting first pick. Pirate code.<br>\
 A lot sold them. But I? Pirate skippers get first pick. <br>\
<br>\
And who better than that haughty thing in a dress uniform. Think I'll stick her here until the party dies down %D.<br>\

 I'll play the savior being all protective. We'll come to an arrangement."

 Of all the things to call me, a Star-lord and Elector-count, aloof!<br>\
 I will have them know I am neither aloof, nor foolish, nor hare-brained, nor all the other petty little words they call me!<br>\
 I will let them call me tyrant and monster! <br>\
<br>\
First, I will put the accouterments of my ship somewhere safe. Then, I shall roam among the swine and take names of the ringleaders.<br>\
 Lastly, the airlocks will need to be waxed down, extra slick. Oh. But I admit, I can be prone to slips of the mind.<br>\

 This happens. This happened last time.<br>\

 All I have to do is get my face rearranged a little, maybe replace my leg augs to be a little shorter. Put on some overalls and turn a wrench for a few months.<br>\
 Get my credentials back when its time to talk to the salvage yard. <br>\

Remember this spot when the anesthetic wears off<br>\

 don't go stumbling around for a week like last time. "
