	Payday is handled in three stages.

1. Information gathering.
	We loop through everyone in the crew, check if they're not suspended or somesuch
	We make a note of all the people who are valid and active, along with how much they should be paid.
	This information is applied to departments in the pending payments list
	In addition each department also records its own fund request

	Note that dead people will still be paid automatically. Its the responsibility of command staff to
	manually suspend payment to the dead

2. Requesting funds:
	Each department will ask its appropriate source to send one lump sum, totalling the amount of all of its
	wage+fund requirements. This payment will either be made in full or rejected, no partial payments
	Requests from an external source will always succeed
	Request from another ship account will succeed if nothing prevents it. EG, adequate funds, not suspended, etc.

3. Payroll
	If the department account now has enough to cover all the wage requests, then they will all be paid.
	Again, no partial payments. Either everyone gets paid or nobody does
