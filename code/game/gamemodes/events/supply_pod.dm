/*
	A (sort of) positive major event. Rare thing!
	Supply pod event causes a drop pod to hit the ship, containing a variety of rare and useful loot.
	Assistants are sure to swarm it and ironhammer will need to fight them off. Or the assistants might die horribly

	The pod causes major devastation where it hits, Technomancers will need to rebuild the room
	It may contain monsters or traps.But it also contains a very large quantity of items,
	including quite a few rares
