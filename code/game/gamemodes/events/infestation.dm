/*
Infestation is the primary combat event. It has a broad pool of mobs, both hostile and peaceful,
Infestation spawns monsters via burrows, and relies on the burrow network to operate.
If players somehow manage to destroy every burrow on the ship, this event will be unable to spawn
It focuses on spawning large numbers of moderate-to-weak monsters, and includes some elements of surprise
