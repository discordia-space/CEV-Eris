/*
	Wall rot causes a corrosive fungus to grow on walls,wearing them down until they eventually become
	weak enough to break with bare hands. This can be useful to people trying to get more access around
	the ship, or to break into sensitive areas. Or even to escape maintenance pits

	It is not marked negative due to this possible advantage
