/*
	Wormholes is an uncommon moderate event which spawns several connected pairs of wormholes around the
	ship.These wormholes are semi-stable and will last for a significant quantity of time. Anywhere from
	a few minutes to several hours, effectively permanantly connecting areas.

	This may require engineering to wall them off, or ironhammer to guard them, to prevent unauthorised access
	If conveniently placed,they may also offer new, rapid transit routes around the ship
