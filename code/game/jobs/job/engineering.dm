If an area is infested with monsters, there's no reason to risk lives trying to repair anything inside there. If one of your people is imprisoned, endangered or accused, you should fight for them.

	description = "You are a technomancer, member of a nomadic tribe of spacefaring engineers. Your people make their living by offering their services to starships, like Eris, and you have thusly taken up residence here. Maintaining the ship is your responsibility, ensure the engine is running, the lights are on, the thrusters are fueled, and the air is breathable<br>\
<br>\
Your duties aboard the ship are many and varied. For a start, at the beginning of a shift, you should make sure the Supermatter engine is started up. This is a complex task, and you should learn from others in your group rather than attempting it yourself. Fueling up the thrusters is next to allow the ship to get anywhere, and again you should learn from others<br>\
<br>\
Once these core systems are setup, you may relax a bit, but you should also devote time to learning and configuring. The power distribution systems can be made more robust. Technomancers are typically responsible for configuring the shield generators too. Shut it down to save power when not needed, make sure its online before the ship travels anywhere.<br>\
<br>\
With the power of construction, you are free to customise the ship to your own uses. Build and remove walls to make things more efficient, or more secure. Construct new machines to extend capabilities and make everyone's lives easier. You can even place traps or construct turrets to keep nosy outsiders out of sensitive areas. The ship is yours to improve and build upon<br>\
<br>\
Make sure your EVA gear is prepared, and you're fully equipped with tools. Modding and upgrading your tools is strongly advised for optimal performance. Toolmods can be found while scavenging maintenance, or purchased from the guild. And always, always carry duct tape.<br>\
You should carry materials too for field repair work, but don't steal entire stacks for yourself - the other technomancers are your brothers and you should share evenly, take only what you need.<br>\
 <br>\
Most importantly, be ready to respond to emergency calls at any time. Parts of the ship may be breached or explode, and its your job to fix it. No matter the cost, no matter the danger, you have the equipment and skills to march into places that would be death to most mortals. It is your responsibility to keep the ship more-or-less in one piece and still able to fly.<br>\
<br>\
Eris is your home, your life, and your livelihood. Take pride in it, and in your responsibilities. You should be hesitant to abandon ship, and try your hardest to prevent that becoming necessary. The engineering department is your sovereign territory, and you should be very wary of outsiders entering uninvited. Your fellow technomancers are your family. Take care of them, treat them well, share everything with them, and solve your problems internally."

	duties = "	-Start up the supermatter<br>\
	-Fuel the thrusters<br>\
	-Manage the shield generator<br>\
	-Repair anything and anyone that needs repaired<br>\
	-Respond to distress calls and patch breaches in the hull.<br>\
	-Keep every part of the ship powered, oxygenated, and ready to use"

	loyalties = "	As a technomancer, your first loyalty is to your fellow technomancers. Ensure they are safe and well supplied, defend them, assist them, and share everything with them. If problems arise between you, ask the Exultant to rule on it. Don't snitch on your fellow clanmates by calling ironhammer. The Technomancer Exultant is the chief of your clan, and in many ways a father figure. Trust in their wisdom and follow their instructions above anyone else's.<br>\
	<br>\
	Your second loyalty is to your ship. Unlike most of your crew, who would simply go home, Eris IS your home. Avoid abandoning ship at all costs. This is where you live and it's worth sacrificing for. Take pride in your work, and make eris something to be cherished."
