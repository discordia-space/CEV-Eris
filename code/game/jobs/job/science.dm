The science wing is located in the second section, starboard side, opposite medical, and your medical colleagues should be fast friends. The medical wing is part of Moebius too, and so you fully share access with each other, and are free to use each others' supplies.<br>\
<br>\
As a scientist, your primary purpose is research, testing, and the advancement of knowledge. You can justify almost anything if its done for the purpose of science, and people have no reason to be suspicious if you stomp around wearing strange devices and carrying stranger weapons still. You should craft, lathe and print anything you can, toy around with it, and figure out how it works in detail. Deeply explore everything you can.<br>\
<br>\
There are a few specialist branches within the research wing that you may delve deeper into:<br>\
	<br>\
	R&D: The manufacture and testing of high tech weapons and devices. This branch shares a lab with robotics, and often works closely together to produce vast machines.<br>\
	Xenoflora: A lab dedicated to experimenting and modifying plant DNA, creating interesting mutated plants that may help the crew<br>\
	Xenobiology: A wing full of cells, for the study of alien life forms. Primarily slimes<br>\
	Xenoarchaeology: A facility for analysing artefacts and finds brought back from expeditions.<br>\
	<br>\
	The Vasily Dokuchaev is the Expedition shuttle, and is intended for going on adventures down to strange sites, and recovering items of value. <br>\

<br>\
You have a broad range of tools and machinery at your disposal, and a similarly broad range of responsibilities. You will also have a constant stream of visitors, and rarely a moment to yourself<br>\
<br>\
The duties of robotics are many, and the lab often benefits from having multiple staff.<br>\
You must maintain, tend to, and upgrade the fleet of synthetics that help keep the ship running. Farther to that, the duty of constructing new robots falls to you too. With the aid of your fabricators, you may turn a pile of sheet metal and wires into sentient life. The robots of the ship are operated by moebius, and its not unknown for roboticists to develop a parental attachment to them.<br>\
<br>\
In addition, your department contains the manufacturing facilities for prosthetic limbs and enhancements. It typically also falls to you to install them too, and thus it is common for biomechanical engineers to work in the robotics lab. This may or may not be in your character's skillset. If surgery isn't your specialty, you may defer the implementation to your colleagues over in Moebius Medical instead, and simply supply the parts for them to install.<br>\
<br>\
Lastly, though they're not commonly used, you have the facilities to construct massive and powerful mechanised vehicles. These have powerful capabilities in mining and rescue, as well as obvious military applications"
