#define LOYALTY_CIVILIAN "As a civilian, your only loyalty is to yourself and your livelihood.<br>\
		You just want to survive, make a living, and get through the day. You shouldn't try to be a hero, or throw your life away for a cause. Nor should you hold any loyalties. Civilians should be easily corruptible, willing to take bribes to do anything someone wants and stay quiet about it."
