	description = "You are a vagabond, journeying through the vast expanses of space upon the CEV Eris. You will not be paid a wage.<br>\
Though this does not mean you have no home, as the Eris is your home. Whatever planet you may have came from a now distant memory.<br>\

You remember boarding the Eris sometime in your past, when it had a different purpose and a different captain.<br>\
Over time you've become accustomed to the dangers of this ship.<br>\
The ID you wear likely not even your own. At least as far as you can remember.<br>\
But this chunk of plastic still can be a rare oddity, that can change your character.<br>\
As an vagabond, you should strive to help out anyone you can. Or at least, anyone who offers you a paying job. Find a way to make money, stay out of trouble, and survive."
