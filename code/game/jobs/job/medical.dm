Your tasks will primarily keep you inside medbay, the place needs to have a doctor onsite at all times to treat incoming wounded. As a general rule, you should not leave medbay if you're the only one in it, make sure someone is covering for you if you go elsewhere.<br>\

As a doctor, a broad range of medical procedures fall under your potential purview. You are not expected to be able to perform all of these yourself, being a specialist is fine. <br>\
<br>\
	-Diagnostics: Figuring out what's wrong and how to fix it as quickly as possible. <br>\
	-General Treatment: Administering bandages, medicine, casts and placing people in a cryocell as necessary<br>\
	-Surgery: Opening the body under general anaesthetic to treat broken bones, organ damage and internal bleeding<br>\
	-Virology: The study and manipulation of viruses<br>\
	<br>\
Divide responsibilities among your colleagues to ensure each patient gets the treatment they need<br>\
You also have full access to chemistry, and can utilize  it if medical is short staffed. But if there is a dedicated chemist on staff, they take priority and the lab belongs to them<br>\
<br>\
Character Expectations:<br>\
You are a real doctor, and as such you are expected to hold a lot of qualifications. You've most likely completed many years of medical study, and hold a PHD in one or more medical fields.<br>\
You are expected to be knowledgeable and competent in at least basic treatment, you may have a specialty though."

	Your secondary responsibility is as a chemical manufacturer for moebius generally. You may be requested to make non-medical chemicals for your colleagues in science, or even for other medical staff. Anyone within moebius should be freely and quickly provided with anything they request. Don't question why, it's above your paygrade.<br>\

	Your third duty is to run a chemical sales outlet. You may get requests from other crewmembers to make acid, chemical grenades, smoke, cleaning products, napalm, or perhaps even just to make medicines. You are fully licensed to sell any and all chemicals to those outside moebius. Sell being the operative word here. If someone isn't an employee of Moebius corp, charge them for their chemicals.<br>\

	description = "You are a Moebius Paramedic, The hero of the hour! While doctors largely spend their time cloistered away in medbay, your job is to be out there on the frontlines. You work in the field, sometimes treating people on the spot, sometimes bringing them back to medical for specialist treatment. <br>\

You have significant medical training, but typically you are not a doctor, and will lack a medical degree. The actual doctors have seniority, and you should follow their orders, especially concerning treatment and diagnosis of a patient<br>\
<br>\
You need to be ready to run at a moment's notice, and as such you should take careful care of your gear. Pack as many medicines, treatments, rollerbeds and other equipment as you can. Be sure to bring along some kind of heavy tool for breaching sealed areas.<br>\
<br>\
When the wounded are inside medbay, you will often act as a porter, transporting patients to and from various specialist treatment rooms. If your labour can save time for a doctor, get to it.<br>\
<br>\
Once your duty to the living is dispensed, your secondary duty is to the dead. You are the designated corpse recovery staff, and you will often need to retrieve bodies from where they died, bring them back and store them in the morgue. This gives a reduction in that player's respawn time.<br>\
<br>\
This is the most dangerous part of your job, and recovery should only be attempted if you can reasonably do so without endangering yourself. If there are hostile creatures preventing recovery, call ironhammer to deal with them.<br>\
<br>\
On a lighter note, since you're so fit and agile, you will often be called upon to run errands. When there's no wounded or dead, a paramedic's duties often involve fetching lunch and coffee for the rest of the medical staff.<br>\
<br>\
Character Expectations:<br>\
Paramedic is a physically demanding job, your character must be fit and strong. No fat bodies allowed<br>\
EVA training is expected, you should be confident in a medical Voidsuit, and optionally in driving an odysseus mech<br>\

Remember that you are a noncombatant. Any weapons you carry should be used for breaching and rescue, not for killing. Use violence only as a last resort to defend yourself or your patient"

	duties = "	Respond to distress calls, extract wounded people from dangerous situations, stabilize them at the scene, and take them to medbay for farther treatment as necessary<br>\

	During quieter times, retrieve the corpses of the dead from around the ship<br>\
	Run errands for the medbay staff, act as their hands outside of the medbay"

	Your second loyalty is to your immediate superior, the Moebius Biolab Officer. Follow their instructions and policies.<br>\
	<br>\
	Your third loyalty is to your fellow colleagues in Moebius, especially those in Moebius medical. You are the lowest ranked personnel in the medbay, and you take orders from everyone else working there."
