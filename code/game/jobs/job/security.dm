		Your second loyalty is to the name and reputation of the ironhammer company. You are often the captain's primary tool in keeping order and you must pride yourself on ensuring commands are carried out, threats extinguished and safety preserved. You may need to carry out unsavory orders like executions, and must balance your professional pride versus your conscience.<br>\
		<br>\
		Your third loyalty is to the crew. As the strongest military force on the ship, any mutiny attempt is likely at your mercy, and if unjustified, it will fall to you to put it down. If the captain has gone mad and a mutiny is justified, your support will be the difference between a peaceful arrest and a bloody civil war in the halls. Without your guns, an insane captain will usually be forced to surrender."

	description = "You are the Second-in-Command of the local Ironhammer regiment, and the defacto leader if the commander isn't around. <br>\
	Within ironhammer you largely hold a desk job, your duties will rarely take you outside of the Ironhammer wing, and you are not expected to interact with civilians. You have enough to deal with as is, and are probably the hardest working member of Ironhammer.<br>\
	<br>\
	You have several core duties:<br>\
		1. As second in command, any of the commander's duties may be delegated to you, if they decide to do so. This means that at any time, you may be expected to handle funding, paperwork, disciplinary matters, planning combat tactics, or even carrying out executions. If there's no commander, these duties fall naturally to you. If there is a commander on site though, you shouldn't make these kind of decisions without consulting them.<br>\
		<br>\
		2. You serve as the ironhammer quartermaster. And as such, it is your job to maintain the armoury, and stocks of other equipment. You should keep track of its contents, and who has what. Make sure weapons and equipment are returned at the end of a shift, and procure new armaments from the guild or from scavengers as necessary to keep supplies up and respond to new threat	s.<br>\
		<br>\
		3. You are the defacto warden, and if there are any prisoners being kept in the Ironhammer brig, it is your responsibility to ensure they are fed, treated appropriately with regard to their legal rights, and ensure they have access to medical care. If necessary you may need to suppress riots or escape attempts within the brig too.<br>\
		<br>\
		4. In times of peace, prepare for war. To this end, you are also the onsite military instructor. If the ship is in a lull and there are no outstanding threats, you should take the initiative to order training drills. Allow junior operatives to train and learn with less conventional weapons and tactics, give lessons on aiming, trigger discipline, hand to hand combat. Conduct drills on threat response, squad tactics, and EVA manoeuvres.<br>\ "

You were probably a medical student or inexperienced doctor when you joined Ironhammer, and you thusly have a combination of medical and military training. You are not quite as knowledgeable as a civilian career doctor, not quite as much of a fighter as a dedicated IH operative, but strike a balance inbetween. Balance is the nature of your existence.<br>\
	<br>\
	Within Ironhammer, you have three roles to undertake. All of your roles can be delegated to others when needed - Moebius Medical for roles 1 and 2, the Ironhammer Inspector for role 3. But you are often the best positioned to carry out these tasks, especially when time is short<br>\
	<br>\
	1. Field Medic. <br>\
	You may be expected to serve on the backlines in a combat situation, treating and stabilising the wounded, making the call as to whether they can return to combat or leave by medivac. You may need to perform emergency trauma surgery in undesireable conditions. <br>\
	You are allowed to be armed, but remember that saving lives, not taking them, is your first duty. Don't be afraid to send patients to moebius medical for proper specialist care.<br>\
	<br>\
	2. Prison Doctor.<br>\
	During quiet times, when inmates are serving in the brig, you will often be required to treat prisoners, criminal suspects, and the condemned. Suicide attempts are common in prison, and you will often be treating a patient against their will, who is attempting to escape. When serving in this role, stay on guard, work closely with the gunnery sergeant, and keep control of the situation<br>\
	<br>\
	3. Forensic Specialist.<br>\
	Solving crimes often requires scientific analysis, and expert rulings from a trusted source within Ironhammer. You will often be expected to analyze blood, chemicals and fingerprints, conduct autopsies, and submit your findings to help track down elusive culprits. In this task, you will work closely with the inspector, and if necessary, he often has the talents to perform these tasks. But his time is better spent questioning and interrogating people"
