	description = "You are the head of the local branch of Asters Merchant Guild, and eris' guild representative<br>\
A staunch entrepreneur, you are motivated by profit, for the guild and especially for yourself. You are here firstly to make as much money as you can, and secondly to keep the crew supplied. You can order things at cargo using the local guild funds, these will not magically replenish so you will run out of money quickly if you don't charge. Take payments by card or cash, and deposit them into the guild account to enable more purchases.<br>\
<br>\
The guild also operates all the vendors on the ship, every credit paid into them goes to your guild account. Naturally operating is a two way street, you are expected, when necessary, to refill those vendors. Or send a technician to do it<br>\
<br>\
You do not recieve a salary, but the local guild funds are yours to use. You may pay yourself as much as you like from that account, take the funds and use them for any purpose.  Bribery is a good one, you can get people to do a lot of things if you flash some cash, and its a good idea to keep a few thousand credits on hand in-cash to bribe your way through potentially difficult situations.<br>\
<br>\
Things to bear in mind:<br>\
	-Nobody has a right to free stuff. You are well within your rights to charge for anything you distribute, and you won't make a penny if you don't.<br>\
	-Eris has few laws on contraband. If someone wants something and they can afford it, you get it for them. Don't try to play moral guardian and don't ask questions. You are not responsible for whatever they do with your products.<br>\
	-Loyalty is a priceless resource, yet cheap to maintain. Don't screw over the miners and technicians working under you. <br>\
	-Charity is a weapon. Used correctly, it can do wonders for your public image.  A few gifts spread around makes for good returning customers"

	loyalties = "As a merchant, your first loyalty is to money. You should be unscrupulous, willing to sell anything to anyone if they can pay your prices. Direct the ship towards profitable endeavours, and press the captain to make choices that will be financially lucrative<br>\
Your second loyalty is to the guild. Ensure it retains good relations with privateers like the captain of Eris, and don't embarass it. This means limiting your price gouging to only moderate levels. If you make an enemy of everyone, it may prove a costly mistake"

	-Staffing the front desk, taking payments and orders, buying up items from scavengers that come to sell things.<br>\

Your primary responsibility is to head out on the Mining Barge, and dig up as much ore as you can on an asteroid. The barge contains all the facilities to process that ore too, and allows you to deliver refined materials ready for use.<br>\
<br>\
All the stuff you dig up goes to the guild, and from then on it's the merchant's responsibility to sell it to other departments. <br>\
<br>\
Your second responsibility is to help out aboard ship, while waiting to reach an asteroid. Quite notably, the roaches infesting the ship make heavy use of burrows to get around. You have the tools and expertise to effectively deal with these burrows, and you should try to destroy them wherever you find them<br>\
<br>\
Your third responsibility is as an unofficial security guard. The guild is a popular target for thieves, and one of the unspoken reasons for keeping rough, sturdy people like you on the payroll is to deter those thieves, and punish them with a swift beating for attempting to steal from the merchant. Try to keep the beatings nonlethal though, murder generates too much bad publicity<br>\
