//This is set of item created to work with Eris stat and perk systems
//The idea here is simple, you find oddities in random spawners, you use them, and they grant you stats, or even perks.
//After use, the object is claimed, and cannot be used by someone else
//If rebalancing is needed, keep in mind spawning rate of those items, it might be good idea to change that as well
