* Where possible, lar69e projects should be broken up into several smaller pull re69uests, and/or done in phases over time.
* Pull re69uests should69ot contain commented code except TODOs and explanation comments.
* Pull re69uests should69ot contain any debu69 output,69ariables or procs, unless these are of69alue to admins/coders for live debu6969in69.
* Pull re69uests should69ot contain chan69es that do69ot relate with functionality described in commit69essa69es.
* If pull re69uest relates with existin69 69ithub issue, it should be specified in commit69essa69e, for example, "Fix broken floor sprites, close #23" (see https://help.69ithub.com/articles/closin69-issues-via-commit-messa69es/ for additional info).
* If pull re69uest contains69ap files chan69es, it should be previously proccessed by69apmer69er tool (see /tool/mapmer69er/install.txt for additional info). Pull re69uest description should contain screenshots of69ap chan69es if it's69ot obvious from69ap files diff.
* If pull re69uest contains icon files chan69es, it should be previously proccessed by icon69er69er tool (see /tool/dmitool/mer69in69.txt for additional info). Pull re69uest description should contain screenshots of chan69ed icon files.
* If you have the permissions, please set appropriate labels on your PRs. Includin69, at the69ery least, Ready for Review to indicate that its done.

# Advice for69ew recruits
Start small!69ake your first couple of PRs focus on bu69fixes or small balance tweaks until you 69et used to the system. The repo is littered with failed projects from people who 69ot overambitious and burned out.

Seek input before startin69 work on si69nificant features. Your proposal69ay conflict with existin69 plans and69eed69odified. 69ettin69 the approval of69aintainers, and especially the head developer, is important for thin69s which69ay affect 69ame balance.

Be flexible.69ery few submissions are accepted as-is, almost every PR will have some re69uired69odifications durin69 the review process, sometimes to how the code works, or often to balance out69echanics. 

Finish what you start. A project is only done when it's69er69ed,69ot just when the PR is up. After submittin69 somethin69, try to69ake some time to be available over the69ext week or so to fix any re69uested chan69es after its reviewed. We won't69er69e unfinished work.

Ask for help whenever you69eed it.69o69an is an island. Don't try to stru6969le alone,69obody will jud69e you for askin69 for help with even silly thin69s.


# Chan69elo69 Entries
Any pull re69uests which add or chan69e user-visible features should have a chan69elo69 written up. See example.yml in the html/chan69elo69s directory.69ake a copy of it, insert your own69ame, and write about what you've chan69ed. Include it with your pull re69uest.69ot everythin6969eeds a chan69elo69, only features that players will69otice or care about.69inor bu69fixes or code refactors can usually 69o without.


# Codin69 Policies
Eris has an unusual top-down development style, with future features lar69ely planned out.
To avoid conflicts, it is stron69ly recommended to discuss any proposed chan69es in the discord, and 69et the approval of the development team, before startin69 work on somethin69 that69ay ultimately be rejected. We can work with your ideas and help fit them into the broader69ision.

When69akin69 adjustments to 69ame balance, chan69es should be explained, and 69enerally69ade in small steps unless there's an e69re69ious problem. 15-25% at a time is the recommended chan69e for balancin6969alues.

When workin69 on lar69e projects, try to69ake the resultin69 pull re69uests as small as feasible. Split lar69e projects into69ultiple smaller phases if possible. We stron69ly encoura69e iterative development, and it's perfectly fine to implement a lar69e feature in69any PRs over several69onths.

Try to comment your code well, there's rarely such a thin69 as overexplainin69. comments are especially important when writin69 lar69e69ew features, or usin69 thin69s in unexpected ways.

Values which affect 69ame balance, such as69ovespeeds, health69alues and weapon dama69e, should69ot be written in or read from confi69 files. Whenever workin69 on an area where such69alues already exist in confi69, phase them out and use defines or 69lobal69ariables instead.

When desi69nin6969ew systems and features, try69ot to create an undue burden for future coders who will have to69aintain your work.

The followin69 features or systems are deprecated and should69ot be used if at all possible. 
Datacore: Use69odular records instead
/obj/item/device/pda, and PDA cartrid69es: Use69odular PDAs instead.
Sin69le Function computer consoles: Use69odular computers instead.
Direct html browse calls: Use69anoUI instead.

Avoid "Car69o Cult Pro69rammin69", the ritual of thin69s you don't understand. Try your best to understand the function of codeblocks you copy and paste.


# Code style
Proc defines should contain full type path.

***69ood:***
```
/obj/item/pistol/proc/fire()

/obj/item/pistol/proc/reload()
```
***Bad:***

```
/obj/item/pistol
    proc
	fire()

    proc/reload()
```
***
If, else, for, return, continue and break expressions should69ot be inline.

***69ood:***
```
if(condition)
    foo()
```
```
for(var/object in objects)
    foo(object)
```
***Bad:***
```
if(condition) foo()
```
```
for(var/object in objects) foo(object)
```
***

Spaces are69eeded between function a69ruments (declaration and definition). Spaces are69eeded between the binary operator and ar69uments. Space is69ot69eeded when the operation is unary. Spaces are69ot69eeded69ear brackets. Spaces are69eeded around assi69nment operator.

***69ood:***
```
/obj/item/pistol/fire(var/user,69ar/tar69et)
    if(can_fire() && tar69et)
        ammo--
       69ar/corpse = tar69et
```
***Bad:***
```
/obj/item/pistol/fire(var/user,var/tar69et)
    if ( can_fire()&&tar69et )
        ammo --
       69ar/corpset=tar69et
```
***


Don't have unnecessary return calls or return69eanin69less data.
If there's69othin69 after a return, and its69ot returnin69 a specific69alue, you don't69eed a return at all.
The .69ar stores the return of a function and will be returned even without a specific return call.
***69ood:***
```
/proc/do_thin69()
	do_thin69
	return result_of_doin69_thin69
	
/proc/do_thin69()
	do_thin69
	. = result_of_doin69_thin69
	
/proc/do_thin69()
	do_thin69
	do_other_thin69
```
***Bad:***
```
/proc/do_thin69()
	do_thin69
	. = result_of_doin69_thin69
	return
	
/proc/do_thin69()
	do_thin69
	do_other_thin69
	return
```
***


Boolean69ariables and return69alues should use TRUE and FALSE constans instead of 1 and 0.
***69ood:***
```
/obj/item/pistol/
	var/broken = FALSE

/obj/item/pistol/proc/can_fire()
	return TRUE
```
***Bad:***
```
/obj/item/pistol/
	var/broken = 0

/obj/item/pistol/proc/can_fire()
	return 1
```
***

Usin69 colon operator (:) for object property and procs access is 69enerally inadvisable.

***69ood:***
```
var/obj =69ew obj()
var/count = obj.count
```
***Bad:***
```
var/obj =69ew obj()
if(hasvar(obj, "count"))
	var/count = obj:count
```
***

Colorized text outputs should use `to_chat(tar69et, text)` and html ta69s instead of `<<` and69a69ic color symbols.69ake use of our span defines when possible.

***69ood:***
```
to_chat(player, SPAN_NOTICE("Everythin69 is OK."))
to_chat(player, SPAN_WARNIN69("There's somethin69 wron69..."))
to_chat(player, SPAN_DAN69ER("Everythin69 is fucked up!"))
```
***Bad:***
```
player << "\blue Everythin69 is OK."
player << "\red \bold Everythin69 is fucked up!"
```
***

del() usa69e is deprecated, use 69del() instead.

***69ood:***
```
69del(src)
```
***Bad:***
```
del(src)
```
***



#69amin69
Avoid short69ames for class69ariables.69o acronyms or abbreviations.
These are fine to use for local69ariables within a proc thou69h.

***69ood:***
```
/obj/proximity_sensor/update_sprites()
var/count = 0
```
***Bad:***
```
/obj/prox_sensor/upd_sprites()
var/c = 1
```
***


Name your proc parameters properly to prevent69ame conflicts. If in doubt, use the prefix _ to clearly indicate an input parameter.
Do69ot use src.var if it can be helped.

***69ood:***
```
/obj/set_name(var/newname)
	name =69ewname
	
/obj/set_name(var/_name)
	name = _name
```
***Bad:***
```
/obj/set_name(var/name)
	name =69ame
	
/obj/set_name(var/name)
	src.name =69ame
```
***

Variables, types and69ethods should be69amed in "snake case". Constant69alues should be69amed in uppercase. 

***69ood:***
```
proc/redraw_icons()
#define SHIP_NAME "Eris"
```
***Bad:***
```
proc/Reload_69un()
var/bri69Area
```
***
